My daughter suggested that I write you; she thinks I may have some sort of neurological condition. For the last 2 weeks, I have had a headache that will not go away and sometimes I have double vision.She is concerned because I seem to keep forgetting things and I know my memory is not the best. Can you steer me to the doctor who could help me?
